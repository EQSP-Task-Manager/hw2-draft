“On the other hand, we _denunce_ with righteous indignation and dislike men _wgo_ are so 
beguiled and demoralized by the charms of _pleasre_ of the moment, so blinded by desire, 
that they _canot_ foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; 
and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through _wekness_ of will, 
which is the same as _saing_ through shrinking from toil and pain. 
These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. 
In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when _nothin_ prevents our being able 
to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided.
But in certain _circumstanses_ and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of _busines_ 
it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. 
The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: 
he rejects _pleazures_ to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.”
